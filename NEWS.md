# version 3.0
* Dependency to rgdal and rgeos are removed, and overall less dependency
* Function names have been changed, with all functions now starting with `cv_`
* The old functions (v2.x) still work to allow appropriate time for adapting the new code
* The CV blocking functions are now: `cv_spatial`, `cv_cluster`, `cv_buffer`, and `cv_nndm`
* Spatial blocks now support **hexagonal** (default), rectangular, and user-defined blocks
* A fast C++ implementation of **Nearest Neighbour Distance Matching (NNDM)** algorithm (Mil√† et al. 2022) is now added
* The NNDM algorithm can handle species presence-background data and other types of data
* The `cv_cluster` function generates blocks based on kmeans clustering. It now works on both environmental rasters and the **spatial coordinates of sample points**
* The `cv_spatial_autocor` function now calculates the spatial autocorrelation range for both the **response (i.e. the binary or continuous data)** and a set of continuous raster covariates
* The new `cv_plot` function allows for visualization of folds from all blocking strategies using ggplot facets
* The `terra` package is now used for all raster processing and supports both `stars` and `raster` objects, as well as files on disk.
* The new `cv_similarity` provides measures on possible extrapolation to testing folds


# version 2.1.4
* fixed CRAN error for ggplot guide 
* added rgdal as a suggest
* changed the crs of raster data in the package to avoid datum warnings

# version 2.1.3
* fix the warning for spatialBlock function on geographic coordinate system

# version 2.1.2
* predefined folds from user-defined blocks are noe accepted
* add seed argument to spatialBlock to have consistent results where needed

# version 2.1.0
* snowfall package for parallel processing is replaces by future.apply package; #7
* future.apply, shiny, shinydashboard, geosphere and ggplot2 packages moved to SUGGESTION packages. These are not install by default and the user is asked if needed. #7
* RStoolbox is no longer used for clustering
* an argument is added to envBlock function for sampling from raster layers
* no dependency on sp package any more
* doParallel = FALSE by default in spatialAutoRange function

# version 2.0.1
* print() and cat() are removed from the functions and verbose argument is added instead

# version 2.0.0
* most of the underlying functions are migrated to `sf` functions;
* the parallel processing changed from `foreach` to `snowfall`;
* the `species` argument in `spatialBlock` function accepts multi-class responses to find evenly distributed records in train and test folds;

# version 1.1.0
* change `spatialAutoRange` function to accepts rasters with low number of pixels; #2
* the `maskBySpecies = FALSE` in `spatialBlock` function is no longer supported;
* the `numLimit` argument in `spatialBlock` function is only accepts numeric values, and 0 means searching for evenly distributed folds;

# version 1.0.1
* add `speciesData` to `spatialAutoRange` function;
